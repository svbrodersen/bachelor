  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The creation of custom bare-metal solution comes with complications.
    \item Could be a deterrent, where alternatives might be more feasible.
    \item In the context of large data centers, the complexity could be worth it
      given large enough magnitude of demand.
    \item In this thesis I demonstrate that custom made solutions are feasible.
    \item A custom computational storage device might be both viable and
      advantageous. However, future research will determine whether the performance
      enhancement justify the investment.
