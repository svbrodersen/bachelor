	\begin{itemize}
		\item Marcelino et al. evaluate three hardware sorting algorithms
		      implemented with Field Programmable Gate Arrays. One being the FIFO-based
		      merge sorting machine with a merge FPGA. They find speed-ups between 1.6
		      and 15 times compared to a quick sort pure software.

		\item Jackson et al. provide a merge sort for sorting with minimal memory
		      usage which aims to reduce the number of WRITES. They find it reduces I/Os
		      and execution time by about 30\%.

		\item Lobo et al. compare the performance of different types of merge sort
		      algorithms. They theorize that the parallelized merge sort algorithm could
		      increase the performance over a serial counterpart.
