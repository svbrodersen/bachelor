# Accelerator-based computer Architecture with RISC-V

An accelerator encompasses a separate architectural substructure with a different set of objectives than the general base processor. Through this manner of design, the accelerator can often give higher performance at a lower cost. It is the goal of this project to delve further into this design principle with the RISC-V architecture as a foundation for development.


## General outline

* Describe the accelerator-based computer architecture and the role the RISC-V processor plays within it.
* Define OS requirements for a specified substructure of the RISC-V based accelerator-based system.
* Design, implement and evaluate given the previously defined requirements.
