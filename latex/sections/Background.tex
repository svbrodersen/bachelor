\ssection{Background}
\subsection{Accelerator-based Computer Architecture}
The concept of offloading is nothing new.
In a team where each member specializes, it seems logical when discussing our day-to-day work environment.
Effective communication between entities while focusing on what we do best seems logical when speaking about work.
However, when it comes to computer architecture, we have heavily relied on the Central Processing Unit (CPU).
An accelerator is a separate substructure designed with different objectives than the base processor.
With this design, the substructure can be optimized for its specific task, often leading to both performance increases and less energy consumption\cite{AA}.
Prominent examples of accelerators include the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which is a major component in most computers today.

\subsection{RISC-V}
Reduced Intruction Set Computer(RISC), more specifically the fifth version (RISC-V). Is an Instruction Set Architecture(ISA), that aims to make the process of
making custom processors targeting a variety of end applications more feasible. Previous ISAs have often been created by private companies, which leads to patents
and a need for a license to develop a specialised processor. These licenses could often take months to negotiate without mentioning the large sum of money involved.
It is assumed that creating a free and open sourced ISA could reduce the barrier of entry and greatly increase innovation along with afforability\cite{ISAfree}.

RISC-V aims to provide a small core of instructions which compilers, assemblers, linkers and operating systems can generally rely on, while still being extendable for more specialised
accelerators. In RISC-V there  are two primary base integer variants, RV32I and RV64I, whcih provide the 32-bit and 64-bit user-level address spaces respectively. However, RISC-V is already
in the works with a RV128I variant which would provide the foundation needed for a 128-bit user address space in the future. In gereral, RISC-V provides standard and non-standard extensions,
where standard extensions should not conflict with other standard extensions, and the non-standard extensions are more highly specialised.
