\ssection{Background}
\subsection{Accelerator-based Computer Architecture}\label{sec:ACA}
The notion of offloading has long been established in specialized teams, where
each member focuses on their area of expertise. This concept seems inherently
logical when discussing day-to-day work environments. Effective communication
between entities, with an emphasis on performing tasks best suited to our
skills, appears to be the foundation of efficient collaboration.
Contrary, computer architecture relies heavily on the Central Processing Unit
(CPU) for executing various operations. An accelerator serves as a separate
substructure designed with distinct objectives compared to the CPU itself. By
offloading the CPU, accelerators can optimize performance and reduce energy
consumption\cite{AA}. A prime example of an accelerator is the Graphics
Processing Unit (GPU), a crucial component in contemporary computers.
This thesis aims to explore the feasibility of adopting a similar design
approach for creating computational storage devices.

\subsection{RISC-V}
Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC), particularly its fifth iteration,
RISC-V, represents an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) designed to simplify
the development of custom processors for various applications. Unlike
proprietary ISAs created by private companies, RISC-V offers a free and
open-source solution that minimizes intellectual property concerns and reduces
entry barriers, promoting innovation and affordability in processor
development.\cite{ISAfree}.

RISC-V aims to provide a small core of instructions which compilers, assemblers,
linkers, and operating systems can generally rely on, while still being
extendable for more specialized accelerators. In RISC-V there are two primary
base integer variants, RV32I and RV64I, which provide the 32-bit and 64-bit
user-level address spaces respectively. However, RISC-V is already in the works
with a RV128I variant which would provide the foundation needed for a 128-bit
user address space in the future. In general, RISC-V provides standard and
non-standard extensions, where standard extensions should not conflict with
other standard extensions, and the non-standard extensions are highly
specialized.

With the rise of ARM\footnote{short for Advanced RISC Machine} based machines
with comparble and in some cases better performance than that of a Complex
Instruction Set Computing(CISC) alternative.\cite{Power_Struggle} RISC-V aims to
provide the same benefits in an open sourced environment. With this RISC-V, more
specifically the 32-bit version, was chosen as the ISA for developement in this
thesis.

\subsection{Computational Storage}
Computational storage can be seen as a subsection of Accelerator-based Computer
architecture. Firstly, it aims to offload the host processor as described in
Section~\ref{sec:ACA} by providing a secondary processors optimized for specific
computational tasks. Secondly, it aims to reduce data movement between the
storage device and the host processor. This would allow the read and writes to
be distributed among multiple RAM sections rather than a single processor. This
could be an integral part of the issues presented in Section~\ref{sec:context},
as a computational storage device would be scalable with the ever-growing need
for large volumes of data processing.


\subsection{Toolchain}
\subsubsection{QEMU}
QEMU is a system emulator, which has the capabilities of emulating both a 32-bit
and 64-bit RISC-V processor \cite{QEMU}. With QEMU I am able to create code intented
for a processor running the RISC-V instruction set even if my development
environment is running a different ISA. For the puposes of this thesis it is the
RISC-V 32-bit version of the qemu virtual machine that will be used.

\subsubsection{LLVM and RISC-V GNU Toolchain}
The LLVM project is a collection of reusable compiler and toolchain
technologies. Most noteably for the context of this thesis clang. Clang is a gcc
compatibile frontend compiler, which aims to provide fast compile times and low
memory use. In tandem with the LLVM compiler back end, clang provides a
library-based architecture such that the compiler can work together with other
tool. This allows for the use of more sophisticated development environments
such as an Language Server Protocol(LSP). Generally clang also provides more
sophisticated error reports making the overall debugging easier. Moreover, clang
provides a crosscompiler capable of targeting the RISC-V 32-bit architecture.

At the time of writing, the lldb debugger connection to the RISC-V QEMU machine
was inadequete for the needs of this thesis. As such the GNU gdb debugger for
the RISC-V target was compiled for use as a debugger for the implementation
section. Furthermore, the RISC-V GNU toolchain provides necessary header files
for the stdlib, which allows for some rudimentary implementations of algorithms
for the compiler to use, one such instance is that of memcpy.
