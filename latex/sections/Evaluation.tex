\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Testing}
Testing has been accomplished by providing a random\_numbers.py file. With 3
seperate integer parameters it creates a random list using pythons standard
random library. The inputs include a lower and upper bound for the list to
generate, together with the length of the list. Once the list is create, running
make will create a .elf file, which contains the parallel mergesort algorithm
with the unsorted list hardcoded within. Once the .elf file is loaded on a
RISC-V processor, it will immediately begin sorting the hardcoded list. The
implementation also needs the value NUM\_CORES defined within the Makefile,
where it both defines a constant NUM\_CORES for the .elf file to use, and the
same value is used for running the QEMU virtual machine.


\subsection{Future work}
NUM CORES HAS TO BE A POWER OF TWO
