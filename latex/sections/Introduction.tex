\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Context}\label{sec:context}
Data centers are becoming increasingly essential in the IT sector. Whether it is
Google's cloud platform, Microsoft Azure, or Amazon's web services, news about
new data centres seems like a daily occurrence\cite{datacenters}. With such scale comes an
ever-growing need for custom solutions and cutting-edge technologies to both
reduce power consumption and improve overall performance.

Historically, solid-state drives (SSDs) served as drop-in replacements for
magnetic disks, utilizing similar interfaces to ensure seamless
integration\cite{ssd_interface}. But the use of SSDs came with multiple
improvements over the magnetic disks of the past, which were hindered by said
interface. Furthermore, flash SSDs were subject to endurance problems, and
issues with wear leveling emerged\cite{write_endurance, NAND_future}. As such,
there was a rapid movement towards Open-channel SSDs that do not have a firmware
Flash Translation Layer(FTL) and instead leave the management of the physical
SSD to the computer's operating system\cite{LightNVM, open-channel}. This
allowed for greater utilization of the SSD, but introduces further data
transferring between the Central Processing Unit(CPU) and the SSD. This
increases the discrepancy between the amount of memory that the CPU uses to
analyze data and the memory it has available\cite{CSDWhereAreWe}.

A solution to the problem could be to offload the CPU and provide computation at
the SSD level. Such a solution has been described as a computational storage
device (CSD)\cite{CSD_what}. This would involve implementing the most commonly used data
manipulations, such as indexing into an SSD or more complex manipulations like
sorting. This thesis aims to investigate the feasibility of a sorting algorithm
running on a stand-alone bare-metal\footnote{\label{note:1}See
Section~\ref{sec:bare-metal}.} processor.


\subsection{Problem}\label{sec:problem}
For computational storage to be a viable solution for meeting the ever-growing
demand for massive data computations, it is essential to investigate whether
implementing a processor designed for such a purpose is feasible. Consequently,
at least two open questions remain unanswered. (1) What type of computation should be
performed by a storage device? (2) Is it possible to implement such computation
on a bare-metal processor?

\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\large \textbf{What computation should be handled by a storage
    device?}}\label{sec:computational} \\
    Among the various instances of large data transfers between a CPU and an SSD,
    sorting a given array stands out as particularly significant. Sorting is
    fundamental in numerous programming scenarios, serving as a core component of
    many search algorithms and playing a critical role in data science. Efficient
    sorting is essential for optimal performance. Due to its time complexity of O(n
    log n), merge sort was selected for further investigation.
  \item {\large \textbf{ Is it feasible to implement such a computation on a
    bare metal RISC-V processor?}} \\
    As the main goal is to offload the primary CPU, it must be investigated
    whether it is at all possible to create a sorting algorithm on a bare-metal
    processor.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Approach}\label{sec:approach}
For this thesis, an experimental approach was taken. First, I introduce a
feasible design for implementing on a bare metal processor. Secondly, I present
an implementation of said design. Third, I evaluate the viability and validity
of the implementation. Lastly, I present shortcomings and proposed further
research. These implementations will be carried out on a QEMU virtual machine
where the code is loaded via a general loader. The QEMU virtual machine is
compatible with the standard RISC-V ISA. However, a few standard extensions are
required for the implementation these including the Control and Status Register
(Zicsr), Atomic Instructions(a), Integer Multiplication and Division (m) and
Compressed Instructions(c) \cite{RISC_priv}.

\subsection{Contribution}
For this thesis, the following contributions have been made:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Present available design patterns when developing a computational
    storage device
  \item Design and implement a specific merge sort algorithm meant for running on a
    bare-metal processor as described in Section~\ref{sec:bare-metal}.
  \item Evaluate the implementation on lists of varying sizes.
  \item Evaluate the viability of custom bare-metal applications for later use
    as a Computational Storage Device.
\end{enumerate}
